# Modern Incognito Dark Theme
A theme that adds the dark Incognito Mode colour scheme to the normal mode of Chrome. It support the new design of Google Chrome since update to version 68. Originally made by Fiddle-N on on [Github](https://github.com/Fiddle-N/material-incognito-dark-theme/).

Incognito mode currently uses a dark colour scheme to distinguish it from normal mode. This theme imitates that colour scheme and applies it throughout the whole browser.

### Github
This theme is fully open-source under the Apache License. Check out the source code on [Github](https://github.com/Fiddle-N/material-incognito-dark-theme/).

### Limitations
All elements of the official Incognito mode dark colour scheme have been ported over where possible. Unfortunately, Chrome bugs and limitations mean that I can't reproduce it with 100% full-fidelity. These are as follows:

1. The URL bar cannot be colored and must stay white. 

Chrome theme devs currently have no ability to colour the address bar.

2. The icons in toolbar cannot be colored white. I have tried any tint combinations but nothing changes, it stay grey.
